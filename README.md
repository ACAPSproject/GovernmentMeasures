# GovernmentMeasures
The COVID19 Government Measures Dataset puts together all the measures implemented by governments worldwide in response to the Coronavirus pandemic. Data collection includes secondary data review. The researched information available falls into five categories:

    Social distancing
    Movement restrictions
    Public health measures
    Social and economic measures
    Lockdowns

Each category is broken down into several types of measures.

ACAPS consulted government, media, United Nations, and other organisations sources.

Please note note that some measures together with non-compliance policies may not be recorded and the exact date of implementation may not be accurate in some cases, due to the different way of reporting of the primary data sources we used.
